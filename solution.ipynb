    "# Chapter 1, problem 16\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a set $S$ with $n$ items and each item carries a value and a weight. Programmatically, we are talking about a collection of objects like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class item:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value, weight):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.weight = weight\n",
    "```\n",
    "A simpler way to represent these items may be with two syncronized arrays as the problem suggests: $S[1\\ldots n]$ for the value of the items and $W[1\\ldots n]$ for their weights. In this representation, $S[i]$ is the value of the $i$-th item and $W[i]$ its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem asks us to identify an element $x\\in S$ that splits the values into two halves: a subset $S_{<x}$ with elements whose values are less than $x$, and a subset $S_{>x}$ with elements whose values are greater than $x$. But with one constraint: the weight of the elements in $S_{<x}$ is less than or equal to half the total weight of all elements in $S$. And the weight of the elements in $S_{>x}$ is greater than or equal to half the total weight of all elements in $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is a modification of the [quickselect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect) algorithm. Quickselect finds the $k$-th smallest element in an array.\n",

    "For this problem we need to compute first the half total weight of all elements in $S$. This is a constant value throughout the iterations:\n",
    "$$ H = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n W[i] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to split the elements to a left and right groups by value around a pivot element. Then compute the weight of one of the groups - let's go for the left one. Determine where the half value would lie (left or right halves) and recurse.\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "As we make decisions about spliting the items into left and right partitions, we need to remember the weight of a partition prior to the next splitting. For that we introduce an accumulator, $A$ to track left partition weights and initialize it to zero.\n",
